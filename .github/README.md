# Watch (Ohrwurm front-end)

Watch is the front-end for the <a href="https://github.com/snek-shipyard/ohrwurm">Ohrwurm</a> project. The Ohrwurm project is the attempt of creating a site that can handle the upload of records with member and project management. A member can have two different roles (supervisor and non-supervisor) and can be assigned to multiple projects. If a member is a supervisor he/she has the rights to execute add/delete/edit functions for members, projects and tracks, if a member is a non-supervisor he/she only has the rights to add tracks. When a member is added the supervisor that created the member gets an automatic generated random password that the member has to change on the next login. The front-end also features <a href="https://github.com/snek-shipyard/react-tag-input">React-Tag-Input</a>, a custom build tag selector where the user can choose the color for the tag.
